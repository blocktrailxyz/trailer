# User Registration & Authentication: Blockchain & OAuth

Our system provides two primary registration methods, ensuring users have both decentralized and traditional authentication options:

1. **Blockchain Wallet Authentication** – Users register using self-custodied blockchain wallets (Sui, Solana, Base/EVM).
2. **OAuth-Based Social Login** – Users authenticate with Google, GitHub, or Telegram via OAuth.
Both methods ensure secure, seamless access while allowing users to link multiple authentication options.
